			<h3><small>The Burj Khalifa</small></h3>
		
		<p>The Burj Khalifa is a skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. With a total height of 829.8 m (2,722 ft) and a roof height (excluding antenna) of 828 m (2,717 ft), the Burj Khalifa has been the tallest structure in the world since its topping out in late 2008.
 </p>
		<p>Construction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004, with the exterior completed five years later in 2009. The primary structure is reinforced concrete. The building was opened in 2010 as part of a new development called Downtown Dubai. It is designed to be the centrepiece of large-scale, mixed-use development. The decision to construct the building is reportedly based on the government's decision to diversify from an oil-based economy, and for Dubai to gain international recognition. The building was originally named Burj Dubai but was renamed in honour of the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the United Arab Emirates, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan; Abu Dhabi and the UAE government lent Dubai money to pay its debts. The building broke numerous height records, including its designation as the tallest building in the world.</p>

			<h3><small>The Palm Island</small></h3>
		
		<p>The Palm Jumeirah is an artificial archipelago in the United Arab Emirates, created using land reclamation by Nakheel which extends into the Persian Gulf. It is part of a larger series of developments called the Palm Islands, including Palm Jebel Ali and Palm Deira), which, when completed, will together increase Dubai's shoreline by a total of 520 kilometres (320 mi).It is located on the Jumeirah coastal area of the emirate of Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates.</p>
		<p>Construction of the Palm Jumeirah island began in June 2001 and the developers announced handover of the first residential units in 2006.

In early October 2007, the Palm Jumeirah had already become the world's largest artificial island. Also at this time, 75% of the properties were ready to hand over, with 500 families already residing on the island. By the end of 2009, 28 hotels were opened on the Crescent.


In a 2009 article describing the collapsing Dubai economy, The New York Times reported that the Palm was sinking. This was confirmed by geological surveys to be taking place at the rate of 5 millimetres (0.20 in) per year. </p>
