          <h3><small>The Burj Khalifa</small></h3>

          <p>The Burj Khalifa is a skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. With a total height of 829.8 m and a roof height of 828 m, the Burj Khalifa has been the tallest structure in the world since its topping out in late 2008.
          </p>
          <p>Construction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004, with the exterior completed five years later in 2009. The primary structure is reinforced concrete. The building was opened in 2010 as part of a new development called Downtown Dubai. It is designed
            to be the centrepiece of large-scale, mixed-use development. The decision to construct the building is reportedly based on the government's decision to diversify from an oil-based economy, and for Dubai to gain international recognition. The
            building was originally named Burj Dubai but was renamed in honour of the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the United Arab Emirates, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The building broke numerous height records, including its designation as the
            tallest building in the world.</p>

          <h3><small>The Palm Island</small></h3>

          <p>The Palm Jumeirah is an artificial archipelago in the United Arab Emirates, created using land reclamation by Nakheel which extends into the Persian Gulf. It is part of a larger series of developments called the Palm Islands, including Palm
            Jebel Ali and Palm Deira), which, when completed, will together increase Dubai's shoreline by a total of 520 kilometres (320 mi).It is located on the Jumeirah coastal area of the emirate of Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates.</p>
          <p>Construction of the Palm Jumeirah island began in June 2001 and the developers announced handover of the first residential units in 2006. In early October 2007, the Palm Jumeirah had already become the world's largest artificial island. By the
            end of 2009, 28 hotels were opened on the Crescent. In a 2009 article describing the collapsing Dubai economy, The New York Times reported that the Palm was sinking. This was confirmed by geological surveys to be taking place at the rate of
            5 millimetres (0.20 in) per year. </p>

          <h3><small>The Burj Al Arab</small></h3>

          <p>The Burj Al Arab is a luxury hotel located in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It is the third tallest hotel in the world. Burj Al Arab stands on an artificial island 280m from Jumeirah Beach and is connected to the mainland by a private curving
            bridge. The shape of the structure is designed to resemble the sail of a ship. It has a helipad near the roof at a height of 210m above ground.</p>
          <p>The old name persisted after the old hotel was demolished in 1997. Dubai Chicago Beach Hotel remained as the Public Project Name for the construction phase of Burj Al Arab Hotel until Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum announced the new name.</p>

          <h3><small>Shark Safari</small></h3>

          <p>In October 2007, the hotel received a shipment of 28 bottlenose dolphins from the Solomon Islands, to be used as part of their aquarium exhibit, called Dolphin Bay. The move was decried by several environmental groups, particularly for the fact
            that the export of dolphins had earlier been banned by the Solomon Islands government (after a similar controversial shipment to Mexico). Hotel managers have said that though the dolphins are being trained to interact with visitors, they will
            not appear in any sort of show or circus-like performance.</p>
          <p>They have also stated that the health of the dolphins is paramount, and because the bottlenose is not an endangered species, their shipment did not pose a problem. The deal was done with the approval of the United Arab Emirates and Solomon Island
            governments, through the company Solomon Islands Marine Mammal Education Centre and Exporters Limited. The amount of money paid for the dolphins has not been disclosed.</p>
